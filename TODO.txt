Other stuff
- Guesses controller
-- # TODO: what happens when it doesn't exist, find_by, find_by_id (don't use), find
---------RESULT: Find throws an error when it doesn't exist, find_by returns nil. Needed to use id: params[:id] for find_by but not find? Not sure why
-- # TODO: flash conventions, full_messages

-- # TODO: Check for when word is nil!!!

- guess model
-- # TODO: test if validate_uniqueness_of works without the scope in this case
---------RESULT: Yes it is required. The reason I questioned it is because a guess belongs to a game, however validates_uniqueness_of checks it against all guesses in the scope, which defaults to all

-- 404 errors?
